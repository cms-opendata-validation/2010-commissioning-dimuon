# 2010-commissioning-dimuon
                        
Validation code for 2010 Commissioning dataset, based on dimuon mass spectrum.
You need to work in a Virtual Machine properly contextualized for CMS.
Everything is available on the CERN Open Data Portal http://opendata.cern.ch/VM/CMS/2010.


In order to run the demoanalyzer_cfg.py to create the Commissioning ROOT files, 
you need to create a working area and set up a proper CMS environment.

## Creating the Working Area

This step is only needed the first time.
```
cmsrel CMSSW_4_2_8
```
## Cloning the 2010-commissioning-dimuon repository from Github
Type this command to change directory:
```
cd CMSSW_4_2_8/src
```
For cloning type:
```
git clone https://github.com/cms-opendata-validation/2010-commissioning-dimuon  Validation/Commissioning_dimuon_2010
```

## Setting up the CMS environment
```
cd Validation/Commissioning_dimuon_2010
cmsenv
```

## Compiling and Running
```
scram b
cmsRun demoanalyzer_cfg.py
```

After analysis, Commissioning00val.root file should be created. 
Then, is necessary to change input and also output files in demoanalyzer_cfg.py, to save these changes and to rerun program. 
In the datesets directory in the repository from github are index files with names:

 CMS_Run2010B_Commissioning_AOD_Apr21ReReco-v1_0000_file_index.txt
 CMS_Run2010B_Commissioning_AOD_Apr21ReReco-v1_0002_file_index.txt
 CMS_Run2010B_Commissioning_AOD_Apr21ReReco-v1_0003_file_index.txt
 CMS_Run2010B_Commissioning_AOD_Apr21ReReco-v1_0004_file_index.txt   

These index files are the same as you can find in the open data portal record http://opendata.cern.ch/record/2 , they are copied here for convenience and for details of the analysis you can read comments in the analysis code DemoAnalyzer.cc .        
It necessary to note that whole analysis can take around 8 hours! 
 
When you rerun for all four index files you should have four root files with names:
 Commissioning00val.root
 Commissioning02val.root
 Commissioning03val.root
 Commissioning04val.root

The last thing what you should do is to merge these four root files into one root file.
You do this as follow. In the downloaded repository is also file with name mergeCommissioning.C .
Press command for opening ROOT program: 
```
root
```
In this programe just type command:
```
.x mergeCommissioning.C .
```
This merging creates a root file called CommissioningAllval.root .
To look at this output, write down command in ROOT program: 
```
new TBrowser
```
and navigate to relevant file. The most interesting histogram is GM_mass_log. This is the validation histogram.
